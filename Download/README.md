# Download
## a client downloads a file from the server.

There is a file named "music.mp3" on the server machine.  
The clients connect to the server socket to get the music file.  
Clients can pause and resume the download process.  
I use `Vagrant` for creating virtual machines and installing the necessary packages on them.  
I created a cluster that consists of two clients and a server for executing these codes.
